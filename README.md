# Bincom Academy C# Beginners Course

This repository contains my work from the **Bincom Academy C# Beginners Course**, where I’m learning the foundations of C# development, web applications, databases, APIs, and DevOps practices using Microsoft technologies.

---

## What I’m Learning

- ✅ C# programming basics
- ✅ Visual Studio and GitHub setup
- ✅ Deploying projects to Microsoft Azure
- ✅ MVC architecture and web app development
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps
- ✅ SOLID principles and clean code design
  

## About This Repo

This project showcases my commitment to learning full-stack C# development with modern tools and best practices. I’m building this portfolio to demonstrate both technical growth and consistency as I move toward junior software development roles.

## Technical Reflection

This project was developed as part of my training with Bincom Academy under the C# Beginners Track. It served as a hands-on learning experience in:

- Web app development using ASP.NET Core MVC, C#, Bootstrap
- Version control and collaboration via GitHub
- Continuous integration and deployment using Azure DevOps and App Services

  
While the portfolio is incomplete, it demonstrates core concepts and development practices. The project includes a Home Page, Resume Page, and Projects Page, each with interactive elements and UI features.
